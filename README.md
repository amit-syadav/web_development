This project is the internship project developed by keval,amit and anmol together as a team members.
To run this prerequisites are:
xampp server
and computer with internet connection

Initially we need to open homepage.php file to get homepage for the site
Then we have a login and registration for the user
The user can create the post and also view all the post

Then on visiting
/user/Admin1.php we will have a login page for the admin where admin can write the post or delete it.

All the required files for the site are provided in the google drive link and also suitable database file are given.


This is the community driven website and also needs further development to make a full fledged blog/aritcle website.
